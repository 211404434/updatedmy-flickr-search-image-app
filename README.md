# updatedmy-flickr-search-image-app
FRONTEND TEST 
Build a client--side web app using a JavaScript framework of your choice. This web app 
should display photos from either Foursquare, Flickr or another service that provides similar 
functionality. 
Using one of the services mentioned above, search for places around a location and display 
the photos found for these locations. You may query the browser for the user’s current 
location and/or ask the user to search for a location by name. 
The focus of this test is to provide a slick, functional client--side web app that provides the 
following: 
1. A page listing locations 
2. A page listing images for a location 
3. A page with details for a specific image 
Please include a set of instructions detailing steps needed to setup and run the web app. 
Optional improvements: 
• Display the photos on a map 
• Allow the user to save a set of favourite locations (you may use local storage in the 
browser for this). 
 
 
Some info about the challenge you’ll start with if you join us: 
• You’ll be working with a team building a platform and a set of products and tools to enable 
real--time productivity and collaboration in sectors where analogue workflows still prevail, 
including media. We are utilising a number of core technologies, including .NET / Core, 
Elasticsearch, SignalR, Azure Storage Queues and will be leveraging machine learning as well 
as compelling existing third--party platforms to achieve our vision for this product suite. 
• In addition to creating code, the responsibilities will include making technical choices for the 
web app. 
• It’s a varied codebase ( Angular , MVC and others ), so a willingness to rapidly expand your 
knowledge in this area needs to be one of your goals.
